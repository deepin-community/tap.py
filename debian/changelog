tap.py (3.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/tests: Remove vestigial support for testing Python 2
  * d/tests: Remove support for ancient versions of autopkgtest
  * d/tests: Use unittest module directly, instead of using nosetest3.
    nosetest3 relies on 2to3, which has been removed.
  * Remove python3-mock test/build dependencies.
    The version from unittest.mock in Python 3.3+ is now used
    unconditionally.
  * Bump debhelper compat level to 13
  * Update standards version to 4.6.0 (no changes needed)

  * d/salsa-ci.yml: Disable blhc to avoid #930993
  * Remove unnecessary B-D on python-docutils
  * Add a build-profile that disables the Python 2 packages.
    python-tap cannot be removed yet because dbus-python Build-Depends on it
    (for its regression tests), but this is a step in that direction.
    Build-depend on debhelper 12.5 for the conditional sequence use.
  * d/tests/control: Mark python2 tests as skip-not-installable.
    Eventually, we want Python 2 to disappear.
  * New upstream release (Closes: #941207)
  * d/copyright: Update
  * d/source/lintian-overrides:
    Override python-depends-but-no-python-helper false positive caused

tap.py (2.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/copyright: use https for Format URI
  * d/.gitignore: add
  * Standards-Version: 4.1.2 (no further changes)
  * Run the unit tests in the C.UTF-8 locale, working around the
    reproducible-builds infrastructure seemingly setting locales that
    it has not generated. In this configuration the tests end up in
    the equivalent of LC_CTYPE=C, which cannot represent the non-ASCII
    characters found in tappy's LC_MESSAGES. Add `locale -a` and `locale`
    output to build logs to diagnose whether this is in fact what is
    happening.
  * Use python3-sphinx instead of python-sphinx to build documentation
  * Build-depend on python-babel to compile localization files

    project. Add a separate smoke-test for tappy(1).
